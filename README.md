# Interactive-Paint-Application
This project implements a simple paint application using Python and OpenCV. Users can draw freely on a white canvas by clicking and dragging the mouse. It demonstrates mouse event handling, dynamic line drawing, and real-time image updatesâ€”foundational skills for GUI and graphics development in computer vision.
